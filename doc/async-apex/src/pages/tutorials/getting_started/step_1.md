Async.apex has a dependency on R.apex. So before we start, we need to include [R.apex](https://github.com/Click-to-Cloud/R.apex/).

Include **Func.cls**, **R.cls**, and **RTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and R.apex is ready.

Then we continue with Async.apex.

Include **Async.cls**, and **AsyncTest.cls**(optional) into your Org, and you are ready to go.
